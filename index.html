            We are <b>THE PRAXIAN GUARD</b>, a North-American based Crowfall band-of-brothers looking to wage war at each other's side.
          </p>
          <p class="px-white">
            We have no ambition to rule over vast kingdoms or make claim to the throne. Our focus lies with each other and the battle before us. The Crowfall fealty and guild system will allow guilds to be part of other guilds. As such, we aspire for THE PRAXIAN
            GUARD to be a highly sought-after mercenary group which can be counted on to show up and change the tide of battle in any campaign in which we enlist.
          </p>
          <p class="px-white">
            Our current ambition is to bolster our roster with other crows able to participate in the Crowfall Alpha and Beta tests. Our long-term goal is grow THE PRAXIAN GUARD into a self sustained army worthy of deployment in campaigns from God's Reach to The
            Dregs and find glory on the battlefield for each other and our gods.
          </p>
          <p class="px-white">
            As Praxians, we enjoy the benefit of belonging to a larger community of gamers, allowing us make friends and play games other than our beloved Crowfall.

          <br>
          <p class="px-black">
            When we were mortal we’d wonder if the gods had forsaken us. Could you blame us? It’s only as Crows we learned of the other worlds and the indiscriminate Hunger.
          </p>
          <p class="px-black">
            Winter came a bit earlier than usual that year. The elders said they hadn’t seen a harsh season like that in decades. And then the snow came the likes of which none had ever seen.
          </p>
          <p class="px-black">
            We were simple folk… craftsmen… farmers… The previous summer we had a bountiful harvest sure, but nothing prepared us for this never-ending winter.
          </p>
          <p class="px-black">
            About eight months in, starvation struck our village. Myself and some others were to travel to the lord’s mansion to look for answers. On the long road the signs of desperation were everywhere we looked. Many trees were decorated with men hung by the
            neck. Misfortune must have come sooner to the other villages and those who stole were granted swift justice.
          </p>
          <p class="px-black">
            The lord had no answers. Instead we were conscripted under his banner to wage war with those who had what we did not. Food… Firewood… Anything. </p>
          <p class="px-black">
            In a period which seemed as though the entire realm was at war with one another… alliances were formed and nations struck down. It was not before long the lord fell to a stray arrow and his armies scattered across the surrounding countryside. </p>
          <p class="px-black">
            Those from our village found each other to make the long journey home. I remember the false hope we had. Honestly, what were we expecting to find? I remember reaching the top of the hill from which you could catch the first glimpse of home, only to see
            it had been burned to the ground. </p>
          <p class="px-black">
            Grief struck, and we cursed the gods whom we thought watched over us. All we had was each other now. </p>
          <p class="px-black">
            It was then the dead started walking. </p>
          <p class="px-black">
            They seemed alive but different. Staggering. Pale. Rotting. Hungry.
            <br> A few of us fell amidst the confusion. </p>
          <p class="px-black">
            It was then we started the Praxian Guard. Going wherever jobs took us to fight the Hunger or those who stood in the way. We became a brotherhood the likes of which only war and struggle can forge. </p>
          <p class="px-black">
            I don’t remember how much longer we lived, fighting like a pack of frenzied wolves. Our enemy was relentless, corrupting man and beast alike more every day. I remember the day I died. It was a particularly cold day. We were outnumbered. No chance. </p>
          <p class="px-black">
            We died as brothers on the battlefield guarding each other’s backs. Blood steaming in the snow. It was then her presence came down from the heavens, embracing me with warmth and light. </p>
          <p class="px-black">
            She had been watching! Why didn’t she give a sign? How could it have come to this? What happened to my battle-brothers? She said there was no time. I had to choose. Peace or eternity. </p>
          <p class="px-black">
            It seems so long ago now. The brothers that made the same choice as I found each other again. </p>
          <p class="px-black">
            Now things are different. The Wolves of Praxus endure. Hunger and man alike, none will stop us on our path. </p>

                based in North America only. It is very likely we will be playing on North-American servers if the choice ever had to be made. You must be aware of this and its impications if you wish to join us from another region of the world.

                Considering the 100% player-run economy and the fact that items degrade with use, we feel crafting will be an essential support system to sustain any player in any campaign. As such we will need crafters to support the more combatant players. Some of
                us will be having dual accounts. Our ambition is to build the Praxian Guard into a self sustained army, so if you're a player who wants to focus purely on crafting you are definately welcome.
